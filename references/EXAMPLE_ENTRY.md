## Context
I've been trying to find a sunscreen that works for my skin type and lifestyle without being too expensive or greasy. I spend time outdoors for recreation and daily activities in Northern California, so protection is important but I also want something that feels comfortable to reapply. I'm interested in both chemical and mineral options but have concerns about potential irritants.

---

## Decision Made
Still in the exploration phase, but leaning toward trying a mineral-based option from [Brand Name] because of balancing protection, feel, and cost. Haven't fully committed yet—want to try it through a full season before deciding this is my go-to.

---

## Reasoning
For me, the key factors are:
1. **Broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection** - non-negotiable for outdoor time
2. **Doesn't feel greasy** - I won't reapply something that makes me uncomfortable
3. **Price point under $15-20** - I reapply frequently, so it needs to be sustainable
4. **No irritants** - I have sensitive skin and some chemical filters cause redness
5. **Easy to reapply** - Simple texture that doesn't require water or special removal

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why I Considered It | Why I Didn't Choose It | Cost | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------|-------|
| Chemical filter (oxybenzone-based) | High protection, lightweight feel | Known sensitizer for me, causes redness | $12-18 | Ruled out early |
| Mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide heavy) | Best for sensitive skin, good protection | Tends to be thick and chalky on my skin | $18-25 | Too heavy for reapplication |
| Hybrid mineral/chemical blend | Could get best of both worlds | Need to find one that actually works | $15-22 | Worth exploring |
| Spray sunscreen | Easy reapplication | Less effective, hard to know coverage | $10-15 | Not considering for regular use |

---

## Products/Resources I'm Using

| Product/Resource | Brand | Where to Find | Cost | Start Date | Status |
|------------------|-------|---------------|------|------------|--------|
| Sunscreen [Brand X] | [Brand] | Target/CVS | $16 | 2026-01-26 | Testing (2 weeks in) |

---

## Key Learnings
- "Mineral" and "chemical" are becoming less meaningful distinctions—hybrid formulas are common now
- Reapplication behavior matters more than SPF number if I'm not actually reapplying
- "Non-greasy" is subjective—some people love heavy mineral sunscreens, they just don't work for my lifestyle
- Price point influences whether I'll actually use it consistently (cheaper = more likely to reapply)
- Some "sensitive skin" formulas still irritate me; need to test, not just trust the label

---

## Personal Factors
- **Skin type:** Combination skin, sensitive to oxybenzone and avobenzone
- **Budget:** Prefer under $20 for something I use regularly
- **Lifestyle:** Outdoors 2-3 hours most days during warm months
- **Texture preference:** Matte or satin finish; strong preference against greasy/heavy
- **Application method:** Prefer cream/lotion, not spray or powder
- **Reapplication:** Realistic about my habits—I'll reapply if it's easy, skip if it's annoying

## What I've Tried & My Thoughts

| Item Tried | Brand/Details | Duration | Results | Would Try Again? | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| CeraVe Face Lotion SPF 50 | CeraVe | 3 months | Left white cast, felt heavy | No | Good for body but not face |
| La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 60 | La Roche-Posay (chemical) | 2 months | Caused slight redness around eyes | No | Seemed to trigger sensitivity |
| Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 50+ | Neutrogena (chemical) | 1 month | Good feel but mild irritation | Maybe | Affordable but skin reaction was the dealbreaker |
| Colorescience Sunforgettable SPF 50 | Colorescience (mineral) | 2 weeks | Too chalky, white cast | No | Beautiful finish but wrong formula for me |
| Trader Joe's Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 | Trader Joe's (mineral) | 1 week | Surprisingly good texture! | Yes | Need to test for actual UVA protection claims |

---

## Action Items
- [ ] Research actual UVA protection rating of Trader Joe's option (SPF 30 seems low)
- [ ] Find 2-3 hybrid mineral/chemical options to test this season
- [ ] Test Brand X for full month to see if it causes any delayed sensitivity
- [ ] Compare cost over 3 months (how often am I actually reapplying?)
- [ ] Ask dermatologist about my specific sensitivities at next appointment

---

## Questions for Next Time
- Are there mineral sunscreens with better skin feel that I haven't tried yet?
- Is there a reason NOT to use a lower SPF (like 30) if I'm reapplying regularly?
- What's the actual difference in protection between "broad spectrum" options—are they all basically equivalent?
- Should I be rotating between different sunscreens or stick with one?
